Welcome to the paladins-api Wrapper!
------------

This is a Javascript wrapper for the Paladins API to simplify making requests and handling the responses.

>**Note:** This wrapper is still in early stages of development. Some API methods are not yet implemented.

<span id="install">Installation</span>
-------------
**1.** Install the package using npm install.

```nmp install paladins-api --save```


<span id="setup">Setting Up</span>
-------------
**1.** Import the package to your entry file. **Ex. app.js**

```const paladins = req('paladins-api'); ```

**2.** Create a new instance of the api class.

```const pal = new paladins('your-dev-id', 'your-auth-key'); ```

<span id="session">Creating a Session</span>
--------------
> **Note:**
> Hi-Rez has limits set in place to throttle requests and sessions. Sessions expire after 15 min so re-creating a session when needed is something that needs to be implemented by yourself.

**1.** Create a new session using the ```connect()``` method.

```
var sessionId;
pal.connect((err, res) => {
	if(!err) {
		sessionId = res;
	};
});
```
First we create a variable called ```sessionId``` so that we can store the session returned from the ```connect()``` method.

In the ```connect()``` method we have a call back function which returns the session in the ```res``` variable. We check for error's and then store the session into the ```sessionId``` variable.

<span id="usage">Usage (Get a player's stats)</span>
--------------

This example is just to demonstrate how the process works. We're going to retrieve a players statistics using the ```getPlayer()``` method.

Every method we use requires a valid session variable to be passed into the function. This is required for signature generation and validation on Hi-Rez's end.

**1.** Create a session using the ```connect()``` method.

**2.** Call the method using the ```sessionsId``` and the Player's username.
```
pal.getPlayer(sessionId, 'HiRez', (err, res) => {
	console.log(res);
});
```

**3.** The response that gets returned is an object that we can now use in our application. In this case, we just console log to make sure it's working.

>**Note:**
>Player name <i>'**HiRez**'</i> returns an empty object because the player does not exist...
